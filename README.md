This portfolio is a demonstration of my skills in:
- ⚛️ **React**: For building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- 🌌 **Three.js**: For stunning 3D graphics and animations.

💡 **Note**:  
- This application may **not work on some mobile devices** due to screen size limitations and the resource-heavy nature of Three.js.  
- It might take a few seconds to render content on initial load. Please be patient while the 3D assets load! ⏳

- 🎨 **Interactive 3D Elements**: Brought to life with Three.js.  
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes (but best viewed on desktops or larger screens).
